## Slack

You only really need to remember one key command for Slack, and that is: 

```
Command + k - Jump to another conversation
```

* If you are in multiple Slacks, then you can use `Command + 1 to 9` to jump between them. 
* You can press `:` to start the emoji picker, to add some colour to your words too.
* Pressing `up` will let you edit the message you've just sent
* Holding `Option` when hitting `Return` will let you write multi-line messages.
